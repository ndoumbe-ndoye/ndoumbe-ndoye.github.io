 <p> This is a jeopardy game created by Milain and Ndoumbe. We have created this trivia game revolving around disney characters, movies, tv shows, and history.
 <br>There are 4 levels of games. We have a 4x4 grid where the first row consists of 100 level questions which are the easiest and it goes all the way to 400 <br>
     level questions which are the hardest questions but have the highest number of points. The player can choose whatever they want to start. For example if <br>
    a player clicks on a card worth 300 points and they get the answer right their score increases by 300 points. If they happen to get the question wrong their
  <br>score stays the same. When all the questions are answered it will show the player their score and thank them for playing our game. <br>
