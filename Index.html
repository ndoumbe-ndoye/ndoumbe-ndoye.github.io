My name is <strong> Ndoumbe Ndoye. </strong> This is the website I made for my CSC 106 course at the University of Rhode island. I am currently undecided so I’m trying different classes to see wich one peek my interest. This is my first year at <strong>URI</strong> and I’m very excited to explore my new opportunities.
