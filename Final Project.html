         <h1> Final project! </h1>
 <p> This is a jeopardy game created by Milain and Ndoumbe. We have created this trivia game revolving around disney characters, movies, tv shows, and history.
                                                                         <br>There are 4 levels of games. We have a 4x4 grid where the first row consists of 100 level questions which are the easiest and it goes all the way to 400 level questions which are the hardest questions but have the highest number of points. 
                                                                         <br>The player can choose whatever they want to start. For example if a player clicks on a card worth 300 points and they get the answer right their score increases by 300 points. If they happen to get the question wrong their score stays the same. 
                                                                         <br>When all the questions are answered it will show the player their score and thank them for playing our game. <br>
